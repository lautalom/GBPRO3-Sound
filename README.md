# GBPRO3-Sound

This script helps run audio in my Galaxy Book Pro 3, following the guide at [Manjaro Forum](https://forum.manjaro.org/t/howto-set-up-the-audio-card-in-samsung-galaxy-book/37090/46) but using this particular file as T0912.sh 


Also see [this comment](https://github.com/thesofproject/linux/issues/4055#issuecomment-1332331409) for reference.
